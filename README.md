# README

Weather tracking app built on Ruby on Rails. Using info pulled from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au) API.

This project is mainly to develop further skills in Rails, and get used to handling APIs.

A live version is available [here](https://rails-weather.herokuapp.com).

Feedback is appreciated but not expected.
